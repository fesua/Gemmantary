                    "content" : "Table tennis is derived from lawn tennis and was initially played as after-dinner entertainment among upper-class English families who would use whatever they could find as equipment. At the time, they would place books on a table to serve as a net, the lids of cigar boxes for rackets and a rounded-off cork from a champagne bottle as the ball. Thankfully, table tennis equipment has evolved over time and in 1926 competitions were organised in Berlin and London, giving rise to the first world championships which were held in London that same year. Enormously popular in Asia, table tennis is played by over 40 million people around the globe, making it one of the most popular sports in the world. Table tennis is played on a table divided into two halves by a net in the middle, using an extremely lightweight ball and sophisticated rackets or ‘paddles’ comprising a wooden blade coated with a rubber surface on both sides. Singles matches are a best-of-seven games format, with the first player to 11 points (by a margin of two clear points) winning each game. Team matches consist of four singles matches and one doubles match, each played in a best-of-five games format. Each team consists of three players and matches end when a team has won three individual games. In doubles matches, players take turns to hit the ball. Table tennis first appeared at the Seoul Olympic Games in 1988, with singles and doubles competitions for men and women. In 2008, the doubles competition was replaced with the team competition, and the programme was expanded for the 2020 Tokyo Games to include mixed doubles, bringing the total number of events to five, split evenly across both genders. Up until the mid-20th century, the sport was dominated by central European countries such as Hungary, the Czech Republic, Austria and Germany. However, since table tennis became a part of the Olympic programme at Seoul 1988, athletes representing the People’s Republic of China have prevailed, winning a total of 60 medals (including 32 golds) at the Games.",

                    "title" : "Description of Badminton",
                    "content" : "Badminton is a racket sport whose exact origins are still a tantalising mystery. It evolved from the older games of battledore and shuttlecock, which were popular pastimes in Europe—particularly among the more affluent classes. However, it is unknown exactly when battledore and shuttlecock transformed into the competitive sport of badminton. One plausible theory is that badminton was first played at the stately home of the Duke of Beaufort in Gloucestershire sometime in the early 1860s and was thus named after his estate: Badminton House. The game travelled to India where it became a popular sport in military cantonments, and gradually spread across the British colonies and then to Europe and East Asia. Today, badminton is a global sport with widespread appeal among people of all ages and abilities. Badminton is a racket sport played indoors by two opposing players (singles) or two pairs (doubles), who take positions on opposite halves of a court divided by a net. Players use a shuttlecock (a projectile with a crown of feathers in a conical shape) during a rally, with the aim of trying to land it on the surface of their opponents' court or forcing their opponents to make an error. A point is won/lost every serve in the game. Players must win two games of 21 points to win the match (best of three). Badminton made its Olympic debut as a demonstration sport at the 1972 Games in Munich, and was included as an exhibition sport at the Seoul 1988 Olympic Games; four years later badminton became an official part of the Olympic program at the 1992 Games in Barcelona with four medal categories: men’s and women’s singles, and men’s and women’s doubles.Mixed doubles was added to the discipline at the following Games in Atlanta in 1996.Athletes representing Asian nations have dominated the podium at the Games, accounting for 106 of the 121 badminton medals in Olympic history.At Paris 2024, 172 athletes will compete in the badminton competition. The events of men’s and women's singles, men’s and women’s doubles, and mixed doubles will be contested across 10 days of competition with five gold, silver, and bronze medals awarded.",

                    "title" : "Description of Artistic Gymnastics",
                    "content" : "Founded in 1881, the International Gymnastics Federation is the oldest international sports federation in the world. The origin of gymnastics dates to antiquity, when it was recommended by philosophers as a way of combining physical exercise with intellectual activity. The sport grew in popularity during the 19th century as an increasing number of competitions were formed, including the gymnastics competition at the newly revived Olympic Games in Athens in 1896. Artistic gymnastics is composed of a number of individual competitions on different apparatus, as well as a team competition involving gender-specific apparatus. Each piece of apparatus requires different skills. Men compete across the floor exercise, pommel horse, rings, vault, parallel bars, and horizontal bar, while women’s events include the vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise. Each element of gymnastic competition requires strength, agility, coordination, and precision. Up until 2004, gymnastic routines at the Games were evaluated with a maximum of 10 points, but from 2005 the mode of scoring changed to a combination of a D score (difficulty/content of the exercise) and an E score (execution) to allow for a greater variation between athletes’ performances. Changes to the scoring system were first considered following the Montreal 1976 Olympic Games, when Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci became the first competitor in history to earn a perfect score of 10.0 for her routine on the uneven bars during the team competition. Artistic gymnastics was introduced at the very first Olympic Games of the modern era in 1896 and has been included in every edition since. The competition was restricted to male competitors for 32 years until the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam, when women were allowed to compete for the first time. It wasn't until 1952 that the women’s programme was developed with seven events, and then later stabilised at six events, as has been the case since the 1960 Games in Rome. There are eight events on the men’s programme.",

                    "title" : "Description of Diving",
                    "content" : "In the early 19th century, gymnasts in Germany and Sweden popularised ‘fancy’ diving by performing elaborate acrobatics while jumping into the water. Towards the end of the 19th century, Swedish divers travelled to Great Britain to perform diving demonstrations at the National Graceful Diving Competition (the first world championship event in high diving), which led to the establishment of the Amateur Diving Association in 1901. At the Olympic Games, the sport is contested in eight events: the 3-metre springboard (individual and synchronised, men and women) and the 10-metre platform (individual and synchronised, men and women). The 3-metre springboard enables divers to leap high into the air, while the high dive is performed from a fixed platform position 10 metres above the water. The individual and synchronised competitions take place at both heights. A panel of judges score each dive based on various criteria, including how aesthetically pleasing a diver’s movements are, the complexity of the dive and how well the diver enters the water. Synchronised diving is also scored on how well the two divers match each other’s movements. Diving made its Olympic debut at the 1904 Games in St. Louis and has been included at every Games since. The first women’s events were contested at the 1912 Games in Stockholm, while the synchronised competition was added to the programme at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. Diving events at the Games were initially dominated by Team USA athletes, though in recent Olympiads competitors from the People’s Republic of China have been formidable (Chinese athletes won 12 of the 24 available diving medals, including seven golds, at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games).",
